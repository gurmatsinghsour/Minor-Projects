                The rule is simple and easy. let's say rock crushes scissors (no need to actually crush). If one user picks
               scissors and the AI stores paper, the user who picked scissors succeeds. Scissors cuts paper. If a user shows
                              paper while the AI stored with rock, the user who picked paper succeeds.
