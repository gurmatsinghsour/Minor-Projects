               The rule is simple and easy. let's say rock crushes scissors (no need to actually crush). If one player picks
               scissors and the other paper, the player who showed scissors succeeds. Scissors cuts paper. If a player shows
                              paper while the other shows rock, the player who picked paper succeeds.
