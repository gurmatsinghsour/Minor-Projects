# Studen internship project 
Topic - Student data management system
It's an organized and systematic office solutoin for the university. it provides a simple interface for maintenance of student informatoin. The functions provided in our program are:
1) Accept - This function takes details from the user and creates a databse for a student in the management System.
2) Display - This fuction displays all the details of every student from the management system.
3) Search - This function searches for a particular student from the list of student from student management system.
4) Delete - This function delets the record of a particular student.
5) Update - This method updates the information of the student in the student management system.

This program was mainly coded on the "def" function in which we have used if-else, while loop and the dictionary.


# Game
Another project I made using modules. the modules used are, 'sys' and 'random'. The game is called, "The guessing game". It's gonna ask users from the terminal to enter the 'main.py' file and after that the index I.e the Initial and the final number, I.e, it's gonna give an index number starting from, let's say I add " 1" as my starting index number and "2" as my last index number and then it's gonna ask me to guess a number within that index number if I guessed it correctly it's gonna print "congratulations, you've.." and if it didn't then it's gonna continue the loop and ask the user to guess the number. If the user typed something apart from numbers it's gonna print as a value error since I used the Try and except function. 

# Password testing
So, Firstly there's a dictionary with a key and a value. My username is stored as a key and its value as my password. I used the Try and except statement to print error if the user has input anything gibberish or an incorrect value, I.e, if suppose you enter a string value in the password it's gonna print as  "value error" or any symbols as "Type error".
if a user inputted a wrong password he'll have 3 tries to attempt the password and it's gonna decrement as you input a wrong password. once the correct password has been inputted, it's gonna print as 'Login successful

# Translator

A translator program. So basically I've used an external library or module named "Translated" which reads a file, it can be a 'txt' file, 'pdf' etc. once it reads then it's gonna ask the user what language does it wants to print, the available languages are, 1). English, 2). Japanese, 3). Chinese, 4). Portuguese.
once you've selected the language that you want the file to translate into then it's gonna print the file and once it is translated, it's gonna make another 'txt' file named 'translated.txt' in the same directory.

# Rock paper scissor

It's a game created with if-else statement logic.
I used the random module and instantiated it to a variable such that that variable will be randomly given out of the three choices, i.e, "r", "p" and "s".
Program will first ask the user to enter it's choice and if it matches with the user (if 'r' == 'r' and etc) it's gonna print as 'Tie' with a bit of customization. If user picks something like 'r', having the the random module giving 's' to the variable that i've declared then it's gonna print as "You've won" with, like again, customization. So this is how the logic works. Make sure you maximize the output tab to enjoy the custom GUI
